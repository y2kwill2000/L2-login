# L2 .NET
L2 .NET is an automated assistant tool (commonly referred to as 'bot') for Lineage 2 that assists a player's experience during their play. It is similar to [L2Divine](http://www.l2divine.com/) and [L2Walker](http://www.towalker.com/).

WARNING: This software is not designed to circumvent anti-bot software nor is it supported for retail versions of Lineage 2. Using this on servers where botting is not allowed is not supported or condoned in any way.

Features
---
* Out of Game Mode, allowing you to fully control your characters without being inside the normal Lineage 2 Client.
* In Game Mode, allowing you to attach to a game client and enhance the gameplay experience (best of both worlds).
* Top-Down Overview map allowing you to interact with the world.
* Combat / Buff/Heal Options to automate skill usage.
* Custom Scripting Support, including packet detection and logic chains
