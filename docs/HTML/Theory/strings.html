Whitespace is ignored when parsing strings.  That is to say, and space or tab will be removed from a command while being parsed.  Be sure to place true strings in double quotes " " to be sure the white space is not removed.<br />
<br />
Order of precedence when parsing variable names is:<br />
<li>local user defined variables
<li>global user defined variables
<li>script defined global variables
<li>dynamic variables created with the preface i, d, or $
