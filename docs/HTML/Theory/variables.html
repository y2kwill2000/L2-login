Variables are the basic building blocks of any programming language.  They are no different in jingjing.  Variables are strongly typed.  This means that a variable must have a type.  jingjing can not guess the type of a variable.  Even siple numbers must be explictly declared a type (ie. the prefixes i, d and $).<br />
<br />
Variables reside on the stack.  For more information about the Stack see <a href="memory.html">Memory and the Stack</a><br />
<br />
Varibles are built of simply defined.  A variable consists of:<br />
<li>an object
<li>a name
<li>a type
<li>a state
<br /><br />
Internally the object is a c# base object that gets cast to the correct type whenever a variable is accessed.<br />
Internally the name is a string that is used to access the variable.  All variables are stored in a sorted list for quick access.<br />
Internally the is a Var_Type enum.<br />
Internally the state is a Var_State enum<br />
<br />
The Var_Type enum lists possible variable types and is used to properly cast a variable to the correct type.  The following types are possible:<br />
<li>NULL
<li>INT
<li>DOUBLE
<li>STRING
<li>FILEWRITER
<li>FILEREADER
<li>ARRAYLIST
<li>SORTEDLIST
<li>STACK
<li>QUEUE
<li>CLASS
<li>BYTEBUFFER
<br /><br />
The Var_State enum lists the possible states for a variable and is looked at to make sure a variable can be accessed from the calling function.  The following types are possible:<br />
<li>PUBLIC
<li>PRIVATE
<li>PROTECTED
<li>STATIC
<br /><br />
PLANNED FOR THE FUTURE<br />
In the future variable will be able to be const.  This will allow users to create readonly variables.  I am undecided on casting variables to and from const... this will probably not be allowed.
