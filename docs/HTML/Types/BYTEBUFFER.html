BYTEBUFFER<br />
<br />
A binary buffer.<br />
<br />
Member Functions:<br />
.TYPE<br />
Returns the global BYTEBUFFER<br />
<br />
.CLASSNAME<br />
Returns a string "BYTEBUFFER"<br />
<br />
.CLONE<br />
Returns a copy of the variable.<br />
<br />
.GET_HEX<br />
Returns the string version of the hex value of this variable.<br />
<br />
.LENGTH<br />
Returns an int containing the length of the binary array in bytes.<br />
<br />
.COUNT<br />
Same as .LENGTH<br />
<br />
.TRIM_TO_INDEX<br />
Resizes the bytebuffer to match the current cursor position.  Use to trim extra length before sending.<br />
<br />
.RESET_INDEX<br />
Resets the index for reading and writing to the start of the buffer (index = 0).<br />
<br />
WRITE_UINT16 [V]<br />
Converts the value of [V1] to a 16 bit unsigned integer and writes it to the bytebuffer.  The cursor is advanced by 2.<br />
<br />
WRITE_UINT32 [V]<br />
Converts the value of [V1] to a 32 bit unsigned integer and writes it to the bytebuffer.  The cursor is advanced by 4.<br />
<br />
WRITE_UINT64 [V]<br />
Converts the value of [V1] to a 64 bit unsigned integer and writes it to the bytebuffer.  The cursor is advanced by 8.<br />
<br />
WRITE_INT16 [V]<br />
Converts the value of [V1] to a 16 bit signed integer and writes it to the bytebuffer.  The cursor is advanced by 2.<br />
<br />
WRITE_INT32 [V]<br />
Converts the value of [V1] to a 32 bit signed integer and writes it to the bytebuffer.  The cursor is advanced by 4.<br />
<br />
WRITE_INT64 [V]<br />
Converts the value of [V1] to a 64 bit signed integer and writes it to the bytebuffer.  The cursor is advanced by 8.<br />
<br />
WRITE_DOUBLE [V]<br />
Converts the value of [V1] to a double precision floating point value and writes it to the bytebuffer.  The cursor is advanced by 8.<br />
<br />
WRITE_BYTE [V]<br />
Converts the value of [V1] to an 8 bit unsigned integer and writes it to the bytebuffer.  The cursor is advanced by 1.<br />
<br />
WRITE_STRING [V]<br />
Converts the value of [V1] to a ubnicode string and writes it to the bytebuffer.  The cursor is advanced by length * 2 + 2.<br />
<br />
READ_UINT16<br />
Converts the next 2 bytes to a 16 bit unsigned integer and returns it.  The cursor is advanced by 2.<br />
<br />
READ_UINT32<br />
Converts the next 4 bytes to a 32 bit unsigned integer and returns it.  The cursor is advanced by 4.<br />
<br />
READ_UINT64<br />
Converts the next 8 bytes to a 64 bit unsigned integer and returns it.  The cursor is advanced by 8.<br />
<br />
READ_INT16<br />
Converts the next 2 bytes to a 16 bit signed integer and returns it.  The cursor is advanced by 2.<br />
<br />
READ_INT32<br />
Converts the next 4 bytes to a 32 bit signed integer and returns it.  The cursor is advanced by 4.<br />
<br />
READ_INT64<br />
Converts the next 8 bytes to a 64 bit signed integer and returns it.  The cursor is advanced by 8.<br />
<br />
READ_DOUBLE<br />
Converts the next 8 bytes to a double precision floating point value and returns it.  The cursor is advanced by 8.<br />
<br />
READ_BYTE<br />
Converts the next byte to an 8 bit unsigned integer and returns it.  The cursor is advanced by 1.<br />
<br />
READ_STRING<br />
Reads the next unicode string from the bytebuffer and returns it.  Reading is stopped when 0x0000 is read.  The cursor is advanced accordingly.<br />
