USE_ACTION [INT] ([INT] [INT])<br />
<br />
[INT1] is the ID of the action to use, followed by values for if control ([INT2]) and shift ([INT3]) are being used.<br />
<br />
Attempts to use the action with id [INT1]. Not all actions send the same use action packet and need to be parsed to send the correct packet out. Don't worry about this. The USE_ACTION command will perform all the parsing behind the scenes for you.<br />
<br />
EX: USE_ACTION 1003 0 0<br />
