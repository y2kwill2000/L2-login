INJECT [STRING]<br />
<br />
Injects a packet into the stream to the SERVER.<br />
<br />
The packet must adhere to the following conditions to have a chance at working.<br />
<br />
1. Use 00 instead of 0 for zero valued hex.<br />
2. Spaces between hex pairs are allowed. (00 00 00 or 000000 will work)<br />
3. Do NOT include the two byte size at the start of the stream. This will be calculated and appended for you.<br />
<br />
(this sample packet is a dud and does nothing, dont try it)<br />
EX: INJECT "00 01 02 03"<br />
