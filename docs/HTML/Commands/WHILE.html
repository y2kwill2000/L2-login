WHILE [V] [conditional] [V]<br />
<br />
while the conditional is true the code between the WHILe and associated WEND will be run.  When the WEND is reached it will jump back up to the WHILE.  If the conditional is false... the code will jump to the line following the associated WEND.<br />
<br />
Like IF, this function needs actual variable names and not values for strong type comparisons.<br />
<br />
EX: DEFINE INT A 10<br />
EX: DEFINE INT B 20<br />
EX: WHILE A < B<br />
EX: //put code here<br />
EX: WEND<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
WEND<br />
<br />
Ends a WHILE conditional statement.  If the conditional is still true... the code will jump back up to the WHILE.  If the conditional is false... code will continue on the next line.<br />
