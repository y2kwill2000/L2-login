GET_TIME [V]<br />
<br />
Grabs the current tick counter and stores it in the variable [V1]. The method of storage will vary based on the type of [V1].<br />
<br />
INT = absolute tick counter (ideal)<br />
DOUBLE = ticks typecast as a double (some rounding will occur)<br />
STRING = absolute tick counter in string form (not good for comparrisons)<br />
<br />
This call returns the TICK counter. Ticks are very small units of time. For your help... plz see the following table:<br />
<br />

Millisecond 10,000<br />
