FOR [V] [INT] [INT] [INT]<br />
<br />
If the variable [V1] does not exist it is created. Otherwise, it is just changed to an int.<br />
<br />
[INT2] = starting value<br />
[INT3] = ending value<br />
[INT4] = step (a negative value will make it step backwards)<br />
<br />
EX: FOR A 0 10 1<br />
EX: PRINT_TEXT "A = <&A&>"<br />
EX: NEXT<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
NEXT<br />
<br />
Causes the associated FOR loop to increase the variable by step. If this new value is greater (or lower if negative) or equal to the end value, it will exit the for loop.<br />
<br />
See above for an example.<br />
