SET was deprecated in v358!  Use = now!<br />
<br />
SET [V] [STRING]<br />
<br />
Used to set the value of variable V1 after creation when not assigning another variable to it.<br />
<br />
The type of the variable is used to determine the type of the value STRING2. Be careful not to assign strings to ints or doubles, or any other weird combo. You may not get the results you expect.<br />
<br />
SET only works with INT, DOUBLE and STRING types.<br />
<br />
EX: DEFINE INT A 10<br />
EX: SET A 100<br />
EX: DEFINE DOUBLE B 10.1<br />
EX: SET B 11.11<br />
EX: DEFINE STRING STR "hello poopy heads"<br />
EX: SET STR "i'm no poopy head<br />
